        <p>About 30 to 40% of people can find clothes that fit them properly. 
        The industry ends up with a lot of unsold clothing, creating waste and missed sales opportunities. To address this, the industry should move from mass production to mass customization, where clothes are tailored to individual needs without losing the efficiency of large-scale production.
            
        Technology can help make this shift. 3D body scanning provides accurate body measurements, allowing for better-fitting clothes. It can also create digital models for customers to "try on" clothes virtually before they are made, saving time and reducing waste. Digital printing offers even more customization, letting customers choose colors and designs.</p>

        <p>The fashion industry is encouraged to move away from fast fashion, characterized by rapid production and low costs, towards slow fashion, which is more sustainable, ethical, and responsible.Consumers are becoming increasingly concerned with environmental and ethical issues, preferring clothing that is unique, high-quality, and has a longer lifespan. This shift is driving brands to reconsider their production processes and business models.Slow fashion consumers value authenticity, locality, exclusivity, equity, and functionality. They are more willing to pay a premium for clothing that meets these values and has a lower environmental impact. Understanding slow fashion consumer behavior is critical for fashion brands. This insight helps in making strategic decisions about product lines, pricing, and communication. Companies like H&M, Mango, and Zara are exploring slow fashion by offering timeless products, higher-quality materials, and more sustainable supply chains.</p>

        <p>The study explores factors influencing online purchase intention among customers of the fashion e-commerce platform SHEIN. It specifically examines the impact of electronic innovativeness, fashion innovativeness, and perceived value, with trust as a moderating variable.Data were collected from 120 SHEIN customers in Biñan City, Laguna, through survey questionnaires and analyzed with statistical methods like Pearson's correlation and linear regression. Qualitative interviews with 10 participants provided additional insights.Trust significantly moderates the relationship between fashion innovativeness and online purchase intention, indicating that fashion-conscious consumers require a higher level of trust to engage in online shopping.These findings suggest that fashion e-commerce platforms should focus on building trust, particularly among fashion-forward customers, to increase online purchases. The research provides insights into consumer behavior, aiding companies in designing better online shopping experiences and marketing strategies.</p>
