        <h2>Home page</h2>
        <p>The home page will include a hero image with a slide show and there will be an about section. This could be done with a library or just through my own java script</p>
        <h2>Order page</h2>
        <p>The order process would have a couple different steps. Orders will consist of the users inputing their own measurements. Users will also be able to select from a limited number of fabric swatch options. At the end of the order the user will review their submission, and they would be able to see their selections and inputed information. I think this should be doable with my skill set. I imagine I would be able to take the user input and spit it back out. </p>
