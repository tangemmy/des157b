    <h2>Observations</h2>
    <p>Overall the tasks were completed successfully, but there were a couple of areas that could've had clearer directions. First thing is when we get to the section where the user should "walk" to the stores, there was slight hesitation on how to get the character to move across the screen. While I intended for a horizontal scroll users ended up clicking the arrow keys to move. I was surprised as I was alwasy using the mouse trackpad to horizontally scroll. Secondly it was slighlty unlear to the user to enter the store by clicking onto the building. One big thing the user missed was clicking onto the donation box to donate the cracked plate. </p>
    <h2>Moving Forward</h2>
    <p>While the user was able to figure out a way to move, I believe it is unclear to the user what they should be doing from the get go. I plan to add some sort of instruction telling the user to use arrow keys or the mouse to move. I would either want to have something highlight the user to click into the building or also include that in the begining directions. Lastly, the user knew they had to buy a new plate as well as speak to the seamstress, given the context of the story before. However, it was unclear that they were supposed to donate the plate as it wasn't mentioned prior. I want to add some sort of checklist to better inform what the tasks are. Another note the user made was that they wanted to go pick up the apron once it was finished being sewn. I didn't plan on being able to pick up the apron, but my wording that it would be repaired quickly led to the user expecting to be able to come back and pick it up. I may add a feature where they can, but for now I plan on changing the wording to have it picked up at a later date. <br> Lastly, I still need to add an ending section to the project which may be our main character coming back home and a description of a sorts of what happened and explaining the world with more context.</p>
